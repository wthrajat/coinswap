//! Coinswap Protocol Messages.
//!
//! Messages are communicated between one Taker and one or many Makers.
//! Makers don't communicate with each other. One Maker will only know the Identity of the Maker, in previous and next hop.
//!
//! Messages are named in  terms of `Sender` and `Receiver` as identification of their context.  They refer to sender and receiver sides of each hop.
//! A party (Taker/Maker) will act as both Sender and Receiver in one coinswap hop.
//!
//! `Sender`: When the party is sending coins into the coinswap multisig. They will have the Sender side of the HTLC
//! and respond to sender specific messages.
//!
//! `Receiver`: When the party is receiving coins from the coinswap multisig. They will have the Receiver side of the
//! HTLC and respond to receiver specific messages.
//!
//! The simplest 3 hop Coinswap communication, between a Taker and two Makers in a multi-hop coinswap is shown below.
//!
//! Taker -----> Maker1 -----> Maker2 ------> Taker
//!
//! ```shell
//! ********* Initiate First Hop *********
//! (Sender: Taker, Receiver: Maker1)

//! Taker -> Maker1: [TakerToMakerMessage::RespProofOfFunding] (Funding Tx of the hop Taker-Maker1)
//!
//! ********* Initiate Second Hop *********
//! Taker -> Maker1: Share details of next hop. (Sender: Maker1, Receiver: Maker2)
//! Maker1 -> Taker: [MakerToTakerMessage::ReqContractSigsAsRecvrAndSender]
//! Taker -> Maker2: [`TakerToMakerMessage::ReqContractSigsForSender`] (Request the Receiver for it's sigs)
//! Maker2 -> Taker: [MakerToTakerMessage::RespContractSigsForSender] (Receiver sends the sigs)
//! Taker puts his sigs as the Sender.
//! Taker -> Maker1: [TakerToMakerMessage::RespContractSigsForRecvrAndSender] (send both the sigs)
//! Maker1 Broadcasts the funding transaction.
//! Taker -> Maker2: [TakerToMakerMessage::RespProofOfFunding] (Funding Tx of swap Maker1-Maker2)
//!
//! ********* Initiate Third Hop *********
//! Taker -> Maker2: Shares details of next hop. (Sender: Maker2, Receiver: Taker)
//! Maker2 -> Taker: [MakerToTakerMessage::ReqContractSigsAsRecvrAndSender]
//! Taker -> Maker1: [TakerToMakerMessage::ReqContractSigsForRecvr] (Request the Sender for it's sigs)

//! Taker -> Maker2: [TakerToMakerMessage::ReqContractSigsForRecvr]
//! Maker2 -> Taker: [MakerToTakerMessage::RespContractSigsForRecvr]
//! Maker2 Broadcasts the funding transaction.

//! ********* Settlement *********
//! Taker -> Maker1: [TakerToMakerMessage::RespHashPreimage] (For Taker-Maker1 HTLC)
